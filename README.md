This is a test project to improve my knowledge of React, Python, and AWS. 

As of 12/5/2021, a simple Tic Tac Toe game is able to be played in the browser. 

Features im considering building: 

-using the Python Flask API project to save moves, games, users in an AWS DB 

-using aws Cognito most likely to ensure correct users are only able to edit their correct games 

-leaderboard

-challenge a user to a game 

-improved React/Front-end css design etc.

Once this repo is cloned, user can CD into the react-flask-app, and execute 
yarn start 
yarn start-api (to launch the python api that currently doesnt really add any functionaltiy)
